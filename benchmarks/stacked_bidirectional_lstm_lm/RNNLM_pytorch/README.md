# Stacked LSTM language model

This is a **PyTorch** implementation of the stacked RNN language model.

In this example, we implement LSTM using frameworks' basic arithmetic primitives (fine-grained operators in framework's terminology) instead of using monolithic LSTM operator.

## Dependencies

This implementation is tested under:

* Python 3.6.5
* PyTorch 1.2.0
* CUDA 10.1
