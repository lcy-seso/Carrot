# Stacked LSTM language model

This is a **TensorFlow** implementation of the stacked LSTM language model on PTB dataset.

In this example, we implement LSTM using frameworks' basic arithmetic primitives (fine-grained operators in framework's terminology) instead of using monolithic LSTM operator.

## Dependencies

This implementation is tested under:

* Python 3.6.5
* TensorFlow 2.0.0-beta1
* CUDA 10.1
